# 📚 Data Structures, Algorithms & Design Patterns (dsa-design)

This is my comprehensive repository where I solve classic **data structure**, **algorithm**, and **design pattern** problems in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Dart**, and **Rust**.

This project aims to:
- Strengthen problem-solving and programming skills
- Explore implementation details across multiple languages
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Deepen understanding of software design principles

## 🧠 What’s Inside

### ✅ Data Structures
- Arrays / Lists
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables / Maps
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Trie)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List / Matrix, DFS/BFS)
- Sets
- Priority Queues
- Union-Find / Disjoint Set

### 🚀 Algorithms
- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization / Tabulation)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, A*, Topological Sort, etc.)
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Bit Manipulation
- Divide and Conquer

### 🏗 Design Patterns
- Creational Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
- Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
- Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)
- SOLID Principles

## 🛠 Languages Used

This repository features implementations in:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🟨 **JavaScript**
- 🎯 **Dart**
- 🦀 **Rust**

Each problem or concept will have a dedicated folder with subdirectories for each language. Example:
